Second Chance 
Second Chance was my final project in University, Secon Chase is a game done on Unity/C# where you play the game has Charlie, a Highschool student that is learning more about himself, after playing one week with Charlie you get the chance to play again with diferent characters, and your choices with those characters can change the history in meaninfoul ways.
Been a choice base game whe focus a lot of our effort in writing the script for the game, so the player would empohatyse and like the characters.
